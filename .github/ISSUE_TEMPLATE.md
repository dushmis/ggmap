## Reproducible Example

Feel free to delete and replace with a description of the feature you'd like if this is not a bug.

Paste a [reprex](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex) here. This helps the maintainers reproduce the bug you encountered. Ensure that the `si` option is `TRUE`.

Example:

```r
reprex::reprex({
    library(ggmap)
    ggmap(get_map())
}, si = TRUE)
```
